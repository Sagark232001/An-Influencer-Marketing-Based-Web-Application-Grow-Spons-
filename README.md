## An-Influencer-Marketing-Based-Web-Application-Grow-Spons


Gone are the days when brands used to advertise their business on television! Old strategies of marketing with the help of offline measures and using TV advertisements are just not enough for the consumer today. Todayâ€™s generation requires a completely different marketing approach as it is ceasing to pay attention to many of the advertising forms used so far. This is where a new type of marketing has come into the picture called Influencer Marketing. An influencer is a person who has the power to influence the behaviour of other people thanks to their persuasiveness. Spending a lot of time in social media, the public willingly follows the persons present in it who they trust. Therefore, in the new market situation, when promoting products, services or brands has never been so difficult, organizations have begun to look for alternative methods of influencing consumers. 

The thing that motivates these influencers is monetization. Companies and brands pay these influencers to promote their businesses. What this new model of marketing lacks is a proper connection window between the influencers and sponsor companies. Both parties require a proper platform on which they could engage and carry out their business. The objective of GrowSpons is to bridge this gap between the influencers and sponsor companies.

The project aims to build a website on which:
<br/>
a) Influencers and Content Creators could post their profiles and link their social-media platform, mentioning the kind of business they would look forward to connecting with
<br/>
b) Companies and Sponsors could look at various profiles of influencers with proper segregation based on Social Media Platforms and the Genre, thus helping them select the right candidate.
